<h1>Harbors</h1>
<section>
    <p>
      The harbors are the beating heart of the fishing economy. Each harbor acts as a home base for fishing fleets,
      offering storage for your catches and a location for specific fish species to spawn and thrive. Harbors vary in size,
      cost, and ecological richness—from small artisanal wharves to massive industrial ports.
    </p>
  
    <h3>Strategy Tips:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Start Small, Think Big:</strong> Lower-fee harbors like <em>Sandbar Point</em> are great for getting started but may limit your long-term capacity.</li>
      <li><strong>Match Your Fleet:</strong> Larger ships or high-volume fishing strategies pair well with high-capacity harbors like <em>Ironhook Wharf</em> or <em>Caldera Bay</em>.</li>
      <li><strong>Diversify:</strong> Consider spreading your operations across multiple harbors to access a wider variety of fish species and trade opportunities.</li>
      <li><strong>Storage Fee Awareness:</strong> Don’t overlook the storage fees—high-value fish can offset these, but volume without value can drain your profits.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <p><strong>Choose your harbor wisely—it can shape your entire fishing strategy.</strong></p>
