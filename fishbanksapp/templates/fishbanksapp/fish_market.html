      This is your guide to the 20 fish species currently populating the waters of OpenFishbanks. Each species has unique traits—
      value, weight, growth rate, and population—that determine how profitable and sustainable your fishing operation can be.
    </p>
  
    <h3>Strategy Tips:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Know Your Target:</strong> High-value fish like <em>Bluefin Tuna</em> offer big payoffs but are heavy and grow slowly.
          Lighter fish like <em>Anchoveta</em> or <em>Herring</em> grow fast and can be harvested in bulk.</li>
      <li><strong>Think Long-Term:</strong> Overfishing a high-growth species may seem smart short-term—but balance is key to sustainability and profit.</li>
      <li><strong>Follow the Habitat:</strong> Some species are only found in specific harbors. Expanding your reach lets you access exclusive stocks.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <p><strong>Tracking species trends and making calculated harvesting decisions is essential to dominating the OpenFishbanks economy.</strong></p>
