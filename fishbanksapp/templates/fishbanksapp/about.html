    <h1>How to Play OpenFishbanks</h1>

    <p>Welcome to <strong>OpenFishbanks</strong>, a multiplayer game where you manage a fishing company and try to maximize profit. This guide walks you through everything you need to know to get started.</p>

    <h2>Game Objective</h2>
    <p>In OpenFishbanks, you play as the CEO of a fishing company.<br>
    Your goal: <strong>maximize your fishery's value</strong> by fishing, buying/selling boats, and managing resources wisely.<br>
    But be careful! The ocean has limited fish, and overfishing can hurt everyone — including you.</p>

    <h2>Quick Start Steps</h2>

    <h3>1. Join a Game</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Go to the home page.</li>
    <li>Create an account or log in.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. View Your Inventory</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Once the game begins, you'll be assigned:
        <ul>
        <li>A base fishing boat (ship)</li>
        <li>Starting cash</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Click <strong>"My Fleet"</strong> to view your ships and their stats.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Make Decisions Between fishing cycles</h3>
    <p>Ships return in cycles of 30 minutes in real life, or around 2 weeks in game,</p>

    <table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
        <th>Action</th>
        <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
        <td><strong>Fish</strong></td>
        <td>Assign your ship to a harbor. Catch amount depends on ship type, harbor location, & fish stock.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td><strong>Buy Ship</strong></td>
        <td>Invest in a new boat to catch more fish.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td><strong>Auction Ship</strong></td>
        <td>Liquidate a boat for cash if you need funds.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td><strong>Dock</strong></td>
        <td>Rest your ship by assigning it to no harbor — it won’t fish, but it also won’t risk breaking.</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>


    <h3>4. Review Results</h3>
    <p>At the end of each fishing trip, you’ll get feedback in the form of an invoice:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>How much fish you caught</li>
    <li>Revenue earned</li>
    <li>Gas and crew fees for each ship</li>
    <li>Harbor fees for each ship</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Winning the Game</h2>
    <p>The game usually runs for a week.<br>
    The winner is the player or team with the <strong>highest total company value</strong> (cash + fleet + inventory) at the end.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Beginners</h2>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Balance</strong> your fleet size with the health of the ocean.</li>
    <li><strong>Watch your finances</strong> — new ships are expensive, and cash flow matters.</li>
    <li><strong>Collaborate or compete</strong> — your choices affect others. Will you play sustainably or aggressively? Its in your interest to work with others through trading and communication</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Multiplayer Dynamics</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>You are not alone. Other players are making similar decisions.</li>
    <li>The ocean’s fish population is shared among everyone.</li>
    <li>Greedy strategies can lead to collapse — but cooperation is never guaranteed.</li>
    </ul>
